## Installation

First we need to install `clickup.js`.

<code-group>
  <code-block label="Yarn" active>

  ```bash
  yarn add clickup.js
  ```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPM">

  ```bash
  npm install clickup.js
  ```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

## Obtain Access Token

Before the package is able to be used we must authenticate with the Clickup API and obtain an `Access Token`. You can read how to do so at the [Clickup API docs](https://clickup.com/api).

Once complete you are now ready to use the package.
