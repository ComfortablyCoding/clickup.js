In your project, initialize an instance of clickup.js

```js
const { Clickup } = require('clickup.js');
const token = '...'; // API access token
const clickup = new Clickup(token);
```

Once you've created an instance, you can use it to access all the features provided by the wrapper, the following example fetches a task by id and displays the response to the console.

```js
(async () => {
 try {
  // get a specific task
  const { body } = await clickup.task.get('9hz');
  console.log(body);
 } catch (error) {
  if (error.response) {
   // The request was made and the server responded with a status code
   // that falls out of the range of 2xx
   console.log(error.response.body);
   console.log(error.response.statusCode);
   console.log(error.response.headers);
  } else if (error.request) {
   // The request was made but no response was received
   console.log(error.request);
  } else {
   // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error
   console.log('Error', error.message);
  }
  console.log(error.options);
 }
})();
```

Additional examples can be view in the [example section](./examples).

<alert>

Due to the HTTP request library being used each error contains an `options` property which are the options Got used to create a request - just to make debugging easier. Additionally, the errors may have `request` and `response` properties depending on which phase of the request failed. Read more about HTTP request library [Got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got).

</alert>

## Caveats

<alert type="warning">

The library is structured to match classes with their respective routes, **NOT** how they are sectioned in the Clickup API docs.

</alert>

For example adding a guest to a task is under the `Task` class instead of the `Guests` class as its route is via `task` and not `guest`. Due to this a request to add a guest to a task will look like so:

```js
(async () => {
 try {
  // guest data
  const guestData = {
   permission_level: 'read',
  };
  // add guest to task
  const { body } = await clickup.task.addGuest('c04', 403, guestData);
  console.log(body);
 } catch (error) {
  if (error.response) {
   // The request was made and the server responded with a status code
   // that falls out of the range of 2xx
   console.log(error.response.body);
   console.log(error.response.statusCode);
   console.log(error.response.headers);
  } else if (error.request) {
   // The request was made but no response was received
   console.log(error.request);
  } else {
   // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error
   console.log('Error', error.message);
  }
  console.log(error.options);
 }
})();
```
